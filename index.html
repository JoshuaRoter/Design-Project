    <p>Lamborghini first started making cars in 1963. This was a big passion of Ferruccio Lamborghini because<br>he was an engineer and could make better cars than Ferrari.
    He went to go ask Enzo Ferrari if he wanted to<br>partner with him and he didnt accept it. This made him go crazy and probably create some of the best cars<br>in the world.</p>

    <p><div class="move">Ferrari was created in 1939 in Italy. This big car company was created by Enzo Ferrari<br>who is the godftaher<br>of super cars. 
    He was an engineer who wanted to learn more about cars since<br>they have been founded.<br>Enzo Ferrari was probably the reason why we even have super cars now in days.</p></div></div>
