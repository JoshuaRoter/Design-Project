<div class="BM"><h1>Bruce McLaren</h1></div>
<div class="ParaBM"><p>Bruce McLaren was the original creator of McLaren. He was a race car driver which<br>
he was one of the best but after he died in 1963, people created McLaren after him since<br>he was one of the best in history. 
He was also an engineer that wanted to create cars.</p></div>

<div class="P1"><h1>McLaren P1</h1></div>
<div class="ParaP1"><p>The McLaren P1 is my favorite McLaren car they have ever created. I say this because it<br>looks super 
good and it cost 2m which means that its very good. This car has 903 horsepower<br>which means it can go from 0 to 60 in 2.2 
sec which is quick.</p></div>

<div class="M720s"><h1>McLaren 720s</h1></div>
<div class="Para720s"><p>The McLaren 720s is like the cheap version of the McLaren P1. I say this because it<br>looks very similar 
to it but doesnt have as much speed as the P1. This supercar has 710<br>horsepower which is 200 less to the P1 and it can go from 0 
to 60 in 2.8 sec.</p></div>
<div class="Pic720s"><img src="543544.jpg" width="300" length="300"></div>
<div class="Speedtail"><h1>McLaren Speedtail</h1></div>
<div class="Paratail"><p>The McLaren Speedtail is a lot different than any other McLarens. This is because it has a<br>flap on the 
back thats made out of carbon fiber that goes up when your breaking to help<br>slow it down. It has 1035 horsepower which is super fast. 
Like this beast can from 0 to 60<br>in 1.8 sec thats impressive</p></div>
